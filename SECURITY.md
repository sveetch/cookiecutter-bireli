# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Because Bireli is project template, once it has been used for a project it is not used anymore in the project itself. Because of this we don't need to ensure security for a project life since it the role of project author.

However, Bireli may contains things which involve to create a project with existing security issues.

So we will only port security fix to the last released version. User are expected to upgrade to last Bireli version for security fixes.
