## Getting started

To navigate our codebase with confidence, see [the introduction to working in the docs repository](/contributing/working-in-docs-repository.md) :confetti_ball:. For more information on how we write our markdown files, see [the GitHub Markdown reference](contributing/content-markup-reference.md).

To know how to start developing on this project, see [Bireli development documentation]([/contributing/types-of-contributions.md](https://cookiecutter-bireli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development.html)).

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/sveetch/cookiecutter-bireli/issues/new/choose).

We will grant ouself the right to close issues that do not fit code of conduct or without any recent activity.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/sveetch/cookiecutter-bireli/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Asking for changes

We think a template projet can not implement every features or use cases to ensure cohesion accessibility, so it is something with strong opinions that may not fit to your needs.

We will try to answer properly to all your feature proposals if they follow our code of conduct, our issues templates and if you take time to correctly expose your ideas, proposals and code contribution.

It is likely we refuse featureq that have a very tiny limited use cases, that we can't maintain (like because it needs too much ressources) or attach Bireli to a proprietary service or technology.

Finally, time ressources to work on this project is limited so don't expect quick resolution, even more if you don't take time to help us to help you.

### Make Changes

Proposed changes have to be done in a dedicated branch, based on last "master" branch version. Then your branch have to be proposed through a Pull Request on Github.

Your work have to fill all quality requirements.

Commit messages are important, we do not want too much noise in Git history, so:

* Respect our commit message format;
* Try to limit commit message to a single line and not too long (120 should be enough);
* Message is only to resume what have be done;
* Commonly a small to medium feature should stand in single commit. So when you are
  done, you should squash your commit to a single one. If you don't, it is possible we
  will squash them ourself and you may lose credits on this work;

Commit message format is exactly:

    [ACTION] Message

Where possible `ACTION` is:

* `NEW`: A new feature or release have been introduced;
* `FIX`: Fixed an issue;
* `CHG`: Commonly, every change that are not a new feature or a fix;
